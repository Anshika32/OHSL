# 🚀 My Projects

Welcome to my repository! Here are my two main projects:

## 📧 Falcon Email Assistant Add-On

The Falcon Email Assistant is a versatile Gmail add-on designed to enhance email management through advanced natural language processing powered by the Falcon-7B-Instruct model from Hugging Face. This add-on provides users with the ability to:

- 📝 **Summarise Emails**: Quickly understand the main points of emails without having to read lengthy texts.
- 📂 **Classify and Label Emails**: Automatically sort emails based on the sender's domain.
- ✉️ **Reply with Custom Subject**: Compose replies with personalised subject lines.

### User Interface and Interaction

With a simple, card-based style, the Falcon Email Assistant makes email management efficient and user-friendly.

### Integration with Hugging Face API

By integrating with the Hugging Face API, the add-on ensures accurate results for email summarisation and replies.

### Learnings from the Project

Building this add-on taught me the power of natural language processing for managing emails and the importance of a user-friendly design.
